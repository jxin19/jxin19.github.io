# About Me

In the meantime, I tried to make beautiful code beyond the clean code. It's a short-term goal to make great code for anyone.

In order to achieve these goals, I will constantly change and make use of related technologies such as Java / Spring and make full use of them. I hope that it will be useful for the development of technology learning such as AWS (IaC), ELK Stack, and Blockchain (Dapp) that I was interested in everyday.

In 2011-2012, I have been engaged in international trade for Chinese clothing wholesalers and naturally came to Chinese culture. I met over 100 friends in China. I have been studying Chinese for over 30 minutes every day with this kind of relationship with China.
